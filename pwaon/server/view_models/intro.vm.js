        "<p><strong>WHAT IS IT ABOUT</strong>" +
        "<br>" +
        "It is a personal transformation work for releasing the unconsciousness human conditioning of the heart" +
        " due to suffering within our current lifetime, parents, ancestors, society/cultural, collective influences, " +
        "etc. The intent of this work is to release the conditioning of the heart and connect to the full spectrum of" +
        " all of energies of the heart - love, compassion, gratitude, peace, harmony, joy, oneness, and many more." +
        " &nbsp; The average person typically carries so much suffering that they are accessing only 0-1% of " +
        "available heart energies. &nbsp;Children between age between 0-4 typically access 80-100%. " +
        "&nbsp;Highly self-realized people which are very rare in current times or in our history such as " +
        "Ramana Marshashi, Papiji, Adyashanti, etc are accessing 90-100% of available heart energies. &nbsp;Even " +
        "some of the best selling authors and well-known contemporary spiritual teachers are only accessing 10-25%" +
        " of their available heart energies. &nbsp;The goal of this work is help people access 80-100% of their heart " +
        "energies and return ourselves to natural states like children.</p>"

        "<p><strong>IS THIS FOR PUBLIC AUDIENCE OR FOR HEALING PROFESSIONALS?</strong><br>" +
        "This is programme for both PUBLIC audience and for HEALING PRACTITIONERS (beginners to advanced).<br>" +
        "For the PUBLIC, this is for everyone &amp; mother, father, engineer, doctor, teacher, artist, psychologist, " +
        "lawyer,&nbsp;etc. &nbsp;This programme is designed to be highly transformative to release the conditioning " +
        "that blocks our hearts, and as we do that many people (not all) are reporting to have found deeper peace," +
        " love, gratitude within themselves and more harmony with family and interacting with their loved ones." +
        " &nbsp;Understand as you work through your own deep conditioning of the heart, all those hurt feelings " +
        "from your lifetime, parents, ancestors, society &amp; collective influences, you in-DIRECTLY transform" +
        " all those around you because your personal healing affects all those connected to you on the DNA level &amp;" +

        " you heal yourself, everyone around you heals ...</p>"
        +
        "<p>For the HEALERS, beginner or advanced, it is by far the most powerful and enlightening program yet." +
        " &nbsp;It is no longer about learning another technique. &nbsp;This program is about doing deep personal " +
        "transformation work and in the process of it developing your ability to access the SUPERCONSCIOUS " +
        "awareness. &nbsp;This state is typically accessed by those who have became fully self-realized" +
        " (enlightened) which is very difficult to do such as Ramana Marhashi, Papiji, Adyashanti, etc." +
        " &nbsp;As we move closer and closer to full self-realization, we take steps toward accessing more and" +
        " more of the SUPERCONSCIOUS. &nbsp;In this space, it is NOT the techniques or methods that are doing " +
        "the work, it is divine energy transmissions activated through the heart. &nbsp;In fact, most healers " +
        "whether beginners or advanced still carry lots of heart conditioning. &nbsp;" +
        "I PERSONALLY HAD A VERY CLOSED HEART, and was an advanced practitioner with a successful practice." +

            " This work is about deep personal transformation and releasing the unconsciousness, human conditioning " +
            "(suffering) of the heart. All suffering is due to suffering in our current lifetime, conditioning by our " +
