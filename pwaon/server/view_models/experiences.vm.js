    title: "OTH-ISness for Improving Relationship with Aging Mother and her Physical Health",
    text: "I am a natural intuitive a spiritual researcher and lay healer. I was researching for some healing " +
    "support when I came across Paul at Chinese energetics. I was interested, and so I signed up for his free " +
    "monthly OTH Transmissions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imbSPvYxpccI felt energy movement and shifts " +
    "and realized that this was a powerful process and that Paul had learned a number of different modalities " +
    "and wondered if Paul could help.I was looking for help for my mother who has mild to moderate Alzheimer�s " +
    "and Osteoarthritis and in considerable pain. I had become exhausted, at a loss as what to do next," +
    " she refused any outside support had stopped eating and it was hard to stop her falling asleep-she was" +
    " also depressed and moaned all the time everything was wrong." +
    "I emailed the website and explained some detail about mum, Paul�s secretary Vanessa liaised with Paul and he" +
    " called me to discuss. " +
    "Paul carefully explained that he would be working with me and how connecting and working this way through" +
    " my own energetic connection to her may support shifts of energy and improvement. After filling out the " +
    "form that asked for specific details, I arranged a block of sessions. " +
    "The sessions were conducted over the phone, Paul was patient and we conducted a series of question and" +
    "answers and I was drawn to the feelings that came up, we went into and worked with the energy; the thoughts," +
    "feelings and concepts. The questions were about my mum- and her issues/ background of her life, this of" +
    " course linked to me. I did not realize how much of those issues was still unprocessed and held within " +
    "me-I thought I had processed much of it. As we carefully went through the stories in this way I" +
    " noticed changes in my energy- Paul helped me to go into those changes: I felt energy moving, " +
    "I felt resistance, I felt turbulence, tingling. I felt energy move in different parts of my body." +
    " I also felt the energy transmission Paul was carefully supporting me with during the process. " +
    "Although I have a deep spiritual understanding, I realized how we think we are so separate, but this" +
    " truly made me feel and confront the reality of who we are and how we affect each other without even " +
    "realizing." +
    "During the first session my mother fell deeply asleep in the chair nearby, after the session she got up" +
    " unaware of what had been happening, she decided to eat a banana!" +
    " We had two sessions directed about mums issues and then we began work on me. " +
    "I didn't send any info we just worked intuitively together. I am still work in progress and taking this" +
    " new information in. This work doesn't stop, I am becoming more aware, old habits die hard and it is " +
    "another step on my journey. I asked Paul to give me homework, so when I check in with him at the next" +
    " session, I can evaluate how I am doing." +
    " Mum is more stable, less depressed and is not quite so centered in her pain, as I progress I will be" +
    " interested to see what happens next. Mum�s life is her journey and her Karma is part of the suffering" +
    " she chooses, it's up to her what happens next, nothing is set in stone. " +
    " It's a complimentary journey of discovery; one that will add to my skill set as well and enables me " +
    "to pass on to others as I learn. " +
    "Thank you Paul for your gentleness and kindness and sharing this journey with me, " +
    "I look forward to our next session." +
    "With gratitude and love"

    text: "I was hanging on to an abuse of power issue from 45 years ago. I was an 11 year old who was" +
    " left in my sister care with a trusted neighbor to check on us. This neighbor whom I had know" +
    " since childhood and loved and trusted got me alone and touched me inappropriately. This incident" +
    " caused me to mix up fear as love. This had a huge impact on my relationships. " +
    "I had social anxiety and suppressed emotions which I was not even aware I was doing." +
    " Until I started energy work I thought my state of being was normal. I came to the realization" +
    " I was in a co-dependent marriage that was not healthy, however, I was so use to relying on my mind I " +
    "doubted my intuition when it told me to leave. I ended up being stuck with suppressed anger making it " +
    "impossible for me to stay and feelings of guilt about leaving. This took a toll on my physical health," +
    " with me ending up weighting less than 100 lbs. and spending time in the mental health system." +
    " Paul support in opening my heart to release the huge childhood anger is a huge step in taking back" +
    " my power. Using Paul's method and support to sense and clear the effect my thoughts of guilt, anger," +
    " and frustration has shown me a path out of stockiness and renewed optimism for the future. Thanks you!"

    text:   "Thanks again for working with me. Some really nice changes have happened in my life just" +
    " over our 4 weeks of sessions. Here's a few examples, Yesterday, I easily let go of the fear and " +
    "anger that was triggered from my daughters behavior. Last year, the same issues threw me into " +
    "a tailspin of trying to fix and control her every which way. Now, I let go of the judgement and " +
    "she has recovered quickly. Next, after 2 years of nasty threatening notes, my ex emailed something " +
    "coherent. This was a huge change and more than a coincidence. The other really great thing was " +
    "that I had the best visit with my mom ever. She has dementia. I was able to be very clear and " +
    "sense what she wanted. We took a short trip to see her friend, and she was able to converse with " +
    "several others that I called on the phone. I believe that she could sense the peace and clarity in me." +
    " Maybe this allowed her to be less stressed and to express herself better." +
    "It was really a big deal for me to imagine that you could help me energetically over the phone." +
    " I have a solid business background and it was a stretch for me to sign up. I've spent years in Al-Anon" +
    " and gone through a gazillion other self help methods. You�ve really helped me have more clarity." +
    " Things are just easier now. I am able to notice and take advantage of some of the many gifts in" +
    " front of me." +
    "I look forward to our next session."
